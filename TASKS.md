### Demo Tasks

#### Constructor Standings Demo Tasks:

Task 1:

The current top constructors are *Ferrari*, *McLaren*, *Mercedes* and *Red Bull*. **Set the time frame to *1998-2024*** and then **select the mentioned top constructors as well as *Alpine*** in the constructor filter. Also, **enable the predictions** (click on '*SHOW PREDICTIONS*'). Now, the line chart presents all of the teams that has won the Constructors' Championship since 1998. Try to answer the following questions:
- A) Look at who won the 2024 season. What year did they last win prior to 2024?
- B) What team do you think has been most dominant within the timeframe?
- C) Do you think the predictions for 2025 are reasonable based on the history?

Task 2:

The current "bottom" constructors are *Alpine*, *Aston Martin*, *Haas*, *Kick Sauber*, *RB* and *Williams*. **Set the timeframe to *2015-2023*** and **select the mentioned "bottom" constructors** in the constructor filter. Notice how Kick Sauber and RB have different names when the last year is set to 2023. 
- A) What was Kick Sauber called 2023?
- B) What was RB called 2023?

Task 3:

The two previous tasks looked at a time interval. Now it is time to look at a single year. **In the timeframe filter, click on '*SELECTION METHOD*'** to change the filter type from *interval* to *specific*. Then, **select the year *2024***. Notice how the x-axis shows the locations for 2024 instead of the years selected. 
- A) At which location did McLaren take the lead in the Constructors' Championship? 
- B) It did not go very well for all of the teams. At what location did Kick Sauber gain their first points, and how many points did they finish with?

#### Driver Standings Demo Tasks:

Task 4:

The Driver Standings are very similar to the Constructor Standings. However, this page utilizes bar chart rather than a line chart. Leave both filters untouched.
- A) What two persons has won a driver championship in the selected interval? 
- B) Based on the trends, who do you think will win the Driver's Championship 2025?

Task 5: 

The sport has had some controversial moments. **Change the selection method of the timeframe from *interval* to *specific***, and **select the year *1994***. This final of the drivers' championship was determined by a crash (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91JoW4mSiZo). Crashing in the sport can often lead to the need of retiring a car, which means no points can be gained.
- A) Who was involved in the crash?
- B) Can you see why the leader of the driver's championship would gain an advantage by crashing into the driver with second most points?

#### Fastest Laps Demo Tasks:

Task 6:

The Fastest Laps can in many cases show what pace the drivers are able to reach for a certain race. **Set the timeframe to only show the year *2024***. In the Grand Prix filter, **select the location *Azerbaijan***. In the driver filter, **select the drivers *Carlos Sainz Jr*, *Charles Leclerc*, *Lando Norris*, *Max Verstappen*, *Oscar Piastri*, and *Sergio Perez***. Notice how the y-axis no longer show the points, but instead the time for the fastest laps the drivers managed to drive during the race.
- A) You have now selected the drivers from Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull. Recall Task 3 from the Constructor Standings demo tasks. The location you have selected (Azerbaijan), was the Grand Prix where McLaren took the lead. Which driver had the fastest lap for this Grand Prix, and what team did he drive for?

Task 7:

Monaco is one of the most iconic Formula 1 locations. In the timeframe, **select the interval *1950-2024***. In the Grand Prix filter, **select *Monaco* as the location**. In the Driver filter, **change the selection method from *specific drivers* to *record***. Also, **enable the predictions** by clicking '*SHOW PREDICTIONS*'.
- A) Who has the record for the fastest lap ever driven in Monaco, and what year was it?
- B) Do you think that the prediction for the fastest lap time 2025 is resonable?
- C) In Formula 1, the weather conditions can really affect the cars' grip. This means that if it is raining, the lap times can be severely worse compared to other years. Since 1950, the trend is that the fastest laps are getting faster, but can you spot at least three years where it has been raining?
